# Dragon Brick v8

This modification creates a "bricked" version of the Dragon Burner by joining the cowl to the mount. Please note that the changes and optimizations are specifically tailored to my personal hardware setup. While this configuration may not be directly applicable to your 3D printer, you can use it as a reference for your own customizations.

The changes reduce the screws required, increase structural strength, reduce plastic required and improve printing.
