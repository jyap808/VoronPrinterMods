Modified from: https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Micron/tree/main/Mods/hartk1213/Pin_Mod

This has been modified to work with the Powge Gates 16T Idlers.

These Idlers are 9mm tall. The bearing stack for the spec Micron model is 8mm tall. The spacing in the model is 8.6mm.

The modification made was to increase the space by 1mm.

To work nicely with the 0.2mm layer height for printing, the following changes where made:
* Left XY joint Lower - Reduce by 0.4mm
* Left XY joint Upper - Reduce by 0.6mm
* Right XY joint Lower - Reduce by 0.6mm
* Right XY joint Upper - Reduce by 0.4mm
